        <h2>3D Design</h2>
      <h3>Armando Botiller</h3>
      <p>Hello friends. It is me, Armando, and I’m head of 3D design. In 3D design we champion design engineering principles although - we’re still learning! The whole idea of championism was born from 3d design, the pursuit of completion, the greedy cup siphon that is development. When the cup empties its contents - it is the frame, the developer, that stands. Although we are auxiliary to the main design group, the process is immensely important; this is because I live by these principles. I also like “Multiplicity” the movie and “Glover” by Hasbro interactive.</p>
