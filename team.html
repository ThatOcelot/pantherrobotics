        <h1>Meet the Team</h1>
      <h2>Programmers</h2>
      <h3>Joaquin Salas</h3>
      <p>My name is Joaquin Salas and I am the lead programmer and co-captain. I have the help of my colleagues Raihan and Nicholas. I am a junior and this is my third year in FTC. I am very hopeful for our team this year and I hope to practice gracious professionalism and have a great time. I love REV Robotics.</p>
      <h3>Raihan Shams</h3>
      <p>My name is Raihan Shams and I am a programmer as well as co-captain. I’m a junior in school while taking a gap year last year to come back to FTC this year. FTC is something that I am passionate about and am happy to come back for this school year.</p>
      <h3>Anthony Kreutz</h3>
      <p>Hi, Hello, Welcome. My name is Anthony. I help out in programming, building, and outreach. Most recently, I designed the website used by Panther Robotics. This is my fourth year in robotics, so I know what’s going on.</p>
      <h2>Builders</h2>
      <h3>Amadi Means</h3>
      <p>I am the head builder on this Robotics Team; I have the help of Alex and Sumaya when building the robot. This is my third year in FTC and second year as a builder. Building has always been a passion of mine; I got into STEM and Robotics when I started building Lego Robotics when I was about 5 or 6, and I have loved to build and design things ever since.</p>
      <h2>Outreach</h2>
      <h3>Saraa Alshawa</h3>
      <p>Hello, my name is Saraa. I am a member of the FTC outreach team. I am a current sophomore, this is my first year in Robotics. I have always had a big interest in robots as they can solve many problems that face the world. I am very glad to be in FTC robotics this year.</p>
      <h3>Yasser Jamal</h3>
      <p>HELLO FRIENDS. THIS IS YASSER SPEAKING! This is my first year participating in FTC Robotics, and I am currently part of the Outreach team. I am very outspoken and competitive. I aspire to become a fluent saxophone player with awesome skills. I also enjoy talking to people and trying new things. I am looking forward to this year in FTC and the wonders it brings!</p>
      <h3>Tariq Omar</h3>
      <p>Hello my name is Tariq Omar. This is my first year in FTC and I am part of our outreach team. Some things about me: I can speak 6 languages, 4 fluently and I am learning 2 more. I also play (acoustic) guitar and the drums. I'm not that great with new people but once I get to know someone and consider them a friend I love them with all my heart anyway thank you for reading this. Hopefully we make it far and do great things.</p>
      <h2>3D Designers</h2>
      <h3>Armando Botiller</h3>
      <p>Hello friends. It is me, Armando, and I’m head of 3D design. In 3D design we champion design engineering principles although - we’re still learning! The whole idea of championism was born from 3d design, the pursuit of completion, the greedy cup siphon that is development. When the cup empties its contents - it is the frame, the developer, that stands. Although we are auxiliary to the main design group, the process is immensely important; this is because I live by these principles. I also like “Multiplicity” the movie and “Glover” by Hasbro interactive.</p>
